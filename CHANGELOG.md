## v0.1.2 — 2026-08-10

iOS-cowork found the shared `errorCopy.identifyFailed` (added in v0.1.1) undersold a common,
often-transient cause: iOS had a richer local string ("...its photos may still be uploading, or
try a clearer shot.") that got dropped when switching to the shared key. Checked whether that
cause is real on web too before enriching the shared copy, rather than taking the iOS framing at
face value — it is: `app/add/multiple/page.tsx`'s batch flow silently drops any photo whose
Supabase upload hasn't resolved yet (`.filter(Boolean)` on `supabaseUrl`) and calls `/api/identify`
anyway, so a still-uploading photo is a genuine, non-iOS-specific identify-failure cause.

- `errorCopy.identifyFailed`: "Couldn't identify this card — try again." → "Couldn't identify this
  card yet — its photos may still be uploading, or try a clearer shot."

No breaking changes — value-only change to an existing key.

## v0.1.1 — 2026-08-10

iOS-cowork follow-up after wiring `@curio/tokens`/`@curio/copy` (CC-1/CC-2): 4 domain error strings
iOS needed had no shared equivalent, so they'd have stayed local, hand-authored copy that could
drift from web. None of these had existing deliberately-authored web copy to extract verbatim —
web's own current fallbacks for these cases are raw technical strings ("Identification failed",
"Failed to load repricing flags") that don't follow the established "Couldn't X — try again" voice
(the same pattern `saveFailed`/`couldNotUpdate`/`couldNotLoadGames` already use), so these are
authored fresh to that pattern rather than carried forward as-is — matching how the "please"
violations were handled in v0.1.0, not a deviation from the extraction discipline.

- `errorCopy.identifyFailed` — "Couldn't identify this card — try again."
- `errorCopy.recommendationLoadFailed` — "Couldn't load pricing — try again."
- `errorCopy.repriceFailed` — "Couldn't reprice — try again."
- `errorCopy.ebayUnreachable` — "Couldn't reach eBay — try again."

No breaking changes — purely additive. `priceSourceLabels` (unchanged since v0.1.0) was also
confirmed against `RecommendResponse.priceSource`'s actual production value set
(`lib/price-providers.ts`'s `PricingResult.source` type in `pokemon-tool`) during this same
follow-up — the 5 keys here already match exactly, including the `cardmarket_proxy` underscore
(the one key that isn't hyphenated like the other 4 — that inconsistency is real, not a typo).

## v0.1.0 — 2026-08-09 (tagged 2026-08-10)

**Tagged.** iOS-cowork review of the Swift dictionary-based shape is complete — confirmed
correct, no changes requested. WORK-BACKLOG.md Packet CC-1 slice 1. Both `pokemon-tool` and
`curio-capture-ios` should pin to this tag (not the pre-tag commit `25ca79a`).

Initial release. Promotes `curio-shared`'s `canon/copy/strings.candidate.json` (landed 2026-08-08,
commit `a760155`) from a documented-but-unwired candidate to a real, pinnable package — same
pattern as `@curio/contracts`/`@curio/tokens`.

- `statusLabels` (legacy `CardStatus` + `PhysicalCard` lifecycle), `attentionQueueCtas`,
  `recommendationRouteLabels`, `conditionLabels`, `priceSourceLabels`, `actionVerbs`,
  `honestyCaveats`, `errorCopy`, `emptyCopy` — extracted from `pokemon-tool`, corrected at the
  source rather than carried forward: the 2 "please" voice-rule violations are gone, and
  `attentionQueueCtas`/`honestyCaveats` no longer bake in web-specific presentation ("→", " — ")
  — see README.md "Composing labels with platform-idiomatic decoration".
- One canonical `formatGBP`/`formatDate` en-GB spec (`src/format.ts` header comment), implemented
  identically in TS and Swift (`Sources/CurioCopy/Format.swift`), both tested against the same
  fixture pairs (`src/fixtures.json`) so the two can't silently diverge.
- Real, confirmed cross-platform drift this package is meant to close (verified directly against
  `curio-capture-ios` `main`, not assumed from the audit): route labels differ on 4/6
  (`list_single` web "List individually" vs iOS "List on its own"; `bundle` "Bundle" vs "Bundle
  with similar"; `bulk` "Bulk" vs "Bulk / job lot"; `hold` "Hold" vs "Hold for now" — `grade_review`
  and `do_not_list` already agreed). iOS's status pill renders the raw enum value
  (`CurioCaptureApp.swift:988`, `s.replacingOccurrences(of: "_", with: " ")` — no case
  conversion), so `READY_TO_LIST` displays as "READY TO LIST", not "Ready to list".
- Swift codegen design: dictionaries (`CurioCopy.RouteLabels.all[...]`), not per-key named
  constants — see `scripts/gen-swift.mjs`'s header comment for why.
- 17 TS tests (`npm test`) + 8 Swift tests (`swift test`) passing.

Was held per the packet's own coordination requirement ("coordinate the `@curio/copy` shape with
the iOS cowork before tagging") — same discipline as `curio-contracts` Packet 9's inline-image
contract. Review is done; the hold is lifted.
